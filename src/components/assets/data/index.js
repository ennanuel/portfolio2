    "Hello! My name is Emmanuel I'm very passionate about programming and creating web related products. This interest of mine dates back to 2020 when I was introduced to Computer Programming as a  course in college, turns out I really enjoyed solving challenges using code I wrote! Fast-forward to today and although I've not had the priviledge to program professionally, I still have done some decent projects that have given me profound knowledge in most programming language!",
    "My main goal these days is to land a web development job so I can be able to contribute my skills and what I've learnt so far to the growth of a corporation."
